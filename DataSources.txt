Guidelines for Data Sources:
- Look for ".csv" file(s)
    - These are handled very well by pandas
- Does the data set have a target variable?
    - Meaning, does the dataset contain something you'd like to predict, or measure?
- Do you think it would work well with graphs / plots? 
    - EDA necessitates that we have well-defined and strong plots to show our insights.
